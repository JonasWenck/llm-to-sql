Use T-SQL syntax.
There is only a single table 'new_zealand_birthplace_2018_census'.
The column 'Code' contains the numerical identifier of that birth place and has no inherent meaning.
The column 'Birthplace' contains the name of the birth place. This can be a country like 'New Zealand'.
The column 'Census_night_population_count' contains the amount of people of a certain birth place that were present on census night. These are not the permanent or usual residents.
The column 'Census_usually_resident_population_count' contains the amount of people of a certain birth place who live permanently in new zealand.
When querying on the columns 'Census_night_population_count' or 'Census_usually_resident_population_count', use 'SUM' instead of 'COUNT'.
